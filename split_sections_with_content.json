INTRODUCTION",
    "The Blockchain Technology and the Era of": "1.1 The Blockchain Technology and the Era of \nTrust -By-Computation.  \n \nIn a white paper published in November 2008, \nSatoshi Nakamoto proposed Bitcoin as the first \nelectronic payment system based on a decentralized \npeer-to-peer network, without the need for a trusted \nthird party. The core technology of this protocol, the \nblockchain, is widely acknowledged as a major \nbreakthrough in fault -tolerant distributed \ncomputing, after decades of research in this field. In \noverly concis e terms, we can define the blockchain as a database that contains all the transactions ever \nexecuted in a peer -to-peer network. It consists of a \npermanent, distributed digital ledger, resistant to \ntampering and carried out collectively by all the \nnodes of the system. The formidable innovation \nintroduced by this technology is that the network is \nopen and participants do not need to know or trust \neach other to interact: the electronic transactions \ncan be automatically verified and recorded by the \nnodes of the  network through cryptographic \nalgorithms, without human intervention, central \nauthority, point of control or third party (e.g. \ngovernments, banks, financial institutions or other \norganizations). Even if some nodes are unreliable, \ndishonest or malicious, t he network is able to \ncorrectly verify the transactions and protect the \nledger from tampering through a mathematical \nmechanism called proof -of-work, which makes \nhuman intervention or controlling authority \nunnecessary.  \nThe rationale for this protocol is the  \ndecentralized trust  or trust-by-computation  and its \nimportance can hardly be overstated: indeed, it \n\nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n46 \nrepresents \u201ca shift from trusting people to trusting \nmath\u201d (Antonopoulos, 2014), with applicability that \ngoes far beyond the creation of decentralized digi tal \ncurrencies.  \nAs an irreversible and tamper -proof public \nrecords repository for documents, contracts, \nproperties, and assets, the blockchain can be used to \nembed information and instructions, with a wide \nrange of applications. These include, for instance : \nsmart contracts, namely automatized, self -executing \nactions in the agreements between two or multiple \nparties; multi -signature transactions, which require \nthe consent of multiple parties for their execution; \nsmart properties, namely  digital ownership of \ntangible and intangible assets embedded to the \nblockchain, which can be tracked or exchanged on \nthe blockchain itself.  \nIn these cases, the advantage of the blockchain \nconsists of removing the need of a trusted third \nparty (e.g. a notary) and enforcing the execution of \ninstructions by a cryptographic code, with \nprotection of participants against risks of fraud and \na significant reduction of management overheads. \nBecause of the remarkable advantages related to \nautomation, transparency, auditability and cost -\neffectiveness, the blockchain may thus represent a \ndisruptive innovation for many varieties of contracts \nand business activities.  \nOther important applications of the blockchain \ninclude for example (Swan, 2015): the creation of \ndecentralized domain name syst em resistant to top -\nlevel domains censorship (e.g. Namecoin); \ndecentralized voting systems for tamper -proof \nballots and election results (e.g. Bitcongress, \nfollowmyvote.com); decentralized autonomous \norganization/corporations/societies \n(DAOs/DACs/DASs ), na mely self -sufficient agents \nderived from artificial intelligence and capable to \nexecute tasks without human involvement, for which \nthe blockchain can provide additional functionality.  \nThe fields of application of the blockchain \nparadigm are potentially cou ntless, since it allows \nthe disintermediation of any digital transaction at \nglobal level. Accordingly, all kinds of business and \nhuman activities are expected to be reconfigured, \nwith a pervasiveness similar to that of the Web \n(Swan, 2015). For this very r eason, the blockchain \nhas been described as fundamental for human \nprogress as the Magna Charta or the Rosetta Stone \n(Swan, 2015), and it is often referred to as a \u201cBlack \nSwan\u201d \u2013 namely an accident of major impact in \nhistory that cannot be anticipated, crea tes surprise \nto the observer and can only be rationalized by \nhindsight (Taleb, 2007).",
    "The Emergence of Blockchain -Based": "1.2 The Emergence of Blockchain -Based \nGovernance.  \n \nThe blockchain technology potentially allows \nindividuals and communities to redesign their \ninteractions in politics, b usiness and society at large, \nwith an unprecedented process of disintermediation \non large scale, based on automated and trustless \ntransactions. This process might rapidly change \neven the tenets that underpin existing political \nsystems and governance models , calling into \nquestion the traditional role of State and centralized \ninstitutions. Indeed, many blockchain advocates \nclaim that the civil society could organize itself and protect its own interests more effectively, by \nreplacing the traditional functions of State with \nblockchain -based services and decentralized, open \nsource platforms (e.g.  Bitcoin, Ethereum). Driven by \nthe enthusiasm for the new possibilities offered by \ninformation technology, along with a profound \ndissatisfaction with the current politic al systems, \nthey hence encourage citizens to be part of the \nblockchain revolution and self -create their own \nsystems of governance, in which centralization, \ncoercion and socio -political hierarchies are replaced \nby mechanisms of distributed consensus.  \nBroadl y speaking, the advocates of \ndecentralization tend to have in common the same \ndissociative attitude towards centralized institutions \nand the State in particular, questioning its capacity \nto create added value (Paquet & Wilson 2015). The \ndominant discourse mostly emerged through the \nmedia, and generally dominated by IT specialists \nand financial operators, sees governments \u201cas \nsomewhat of an encumbrance \u2013 too slow, too \ncorrupt, too lacking in innovation, and benefiting \ntoo few\u201d (Paquet & Wilson 2015, p. 21). It is \nimportant to note, however, that there exists a \ncertain variety of positions towards to the role of the \nState in the blockchain governance, and the dividing \nlines between disintermediation of government \nservices, free market and even anarchism are of ten \nblurred.  \nMany enthusiasts simply promote the \nblockchain as a more efficient, decentralized and \nconsensus -driven public repository, which can have \na number of applications in order to make citizens \nless dependent on governments, yet within a society \nthat is ultimately founded upon the State authority. \nTechno -libertarians and crypto -anarchists hold \ninstead a more extremist position. They are \ngenerally inclined to consider the State as an \nillegitimate, unnecessary and irremediably obsolete \ndepository of po wer, and they openly encourage the \nuse of the blockchain as a liberating force against \nthe very concept of authority. According to this \nview, we are at a stage in history when individuals \ncan gradually overcome any centralized political \ninstitution through  algorithm -based distributed \nconsensus and create the conditions for an idealistic \nsociety of equals, characterized by flat, rather than \nhierarchical, structures.  \nAlthough the view about the role of the State \nmay differ, a growing category of political \ntechnopreneurs and evangelists of decentralization \nhave already developed projects for the creation of \ncryptonations \u2013 namely stateless, do -it-yourself \ngovernance services entirely based on the blockchain \n(e.g. Bitnation). The aim of this paper is to critical ly \nexamine such proposals, which challenge to varying \ndegrees the traditional mechanisms of State \nauthority, citizenship and democracy.  \nWe would point out that applications of \nblockchain technology are still in a defining stage \nand they represent an extrem ely fast -moving field, \nwith little established theory, few recognized experts \nand no easy answers. Scholar debate on this subject \nis still in its infancy and mostly dominated by \ntechnical, financial and legal issues related to \nBitcoin. As a consequence,  a comprehensive analysis \nof the impact of blockchain technology on political \ngovernance and democracy at large is severely \nlacking to date. We hope that our paper will increase \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n47 \nthe understanding of problems at stake and \nmotivate further study and transdiscip linary \nresearch in this field, which certainly requires \ncareful consideration.  \nThis paper is organized as follows.  \nAfter presenting the key principles and \nassumptions related to the blockchain -based \ngovernance (Section II), also in an historical \nperspectiv e (Section III), we will assess risks and \nbenefits of a possible migration of government \nservices to blockchain -based platforms (Section IV). \nWe will then verify the performance of blockchain \nand decentralization platforms as hyper -political \ntools, capable  to manage social interactions on large \nscale and dismiss any central political authority \n(Section V): the analysis will particularly focus on \nrisks related to a dominant position of private \npowers in distributed ecosystems and on the \npossible emergence of  a stateless global society . The \npaper will also investigate whether and to which \nextent the blockchain governance can mitigate \ncoercion, centralization and hierarchic structures in \nsociety (Section VI). Although the blockchain \ngovernance is technically ab le to disrupt the idea of \nState, conclusions (Section VII) will show that it \ncannot be considered a standalone political theory.  \nWe wish to stress that the purpose of this \npaper is not to advocate  the idea of State a priori, as \nan immovable institution. We  are aware that the \ncomplexity of an increasing interconnected society \nrequires overcoming some limits of the nation -state, \nand we are hence fully in agreement on the necessity \nto promote citizens -based participatory politics to \nthe greatest extent: in a t rue democracy indeed, \ncitizens should never be just passive recipients of \nState paternalism (Paquet & Wilson, 2015). And yet, \neven if the transformative power of the blockchain \non society cannot be overrated, an objective analysis \nof its political applicat ions should not be prone \ntowards any technological determinism. On the \ncontrary, proposals for new models of governance \nshould be investigated with great care and critically \nassessed, especially against the risk to promote anti -\npolitical instruments or to conceive politics \naccording to mere market logic.  \n \n2. THE BLOCKCHAIN -BASED GOVERNANCE: \nFUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND \nASSUMPTIONS  \nTo date, a comprehensive discussion of possible \nblockchain -based political models does not yet exist \nat academic level. Since a coher ent and consistent \nbody of thought on this subject is missing, for the \npurpose of our research we have collected \ninformation from a number of sources as accurately \nas possible, though probably in a non -exhaustive \nmanner. Swan (2015) represents a valuable p oint of \nreference for our analysis, since the author offers a \ndetailed and complete overview of possible \napplications of the blockchain technology, including \ngovernment services. Some of the assumptions, \nproposals and visions presented below have arisen \nthrough the Internet within a growing global \nnetwork of new technologies supporters, \npractitioners and entrepreneurs; other ideas instead \nseem to be recurrent themes in conferences, blogs, \nforums and specialist websites, and for all we know they are not excl usively attributable to a specific \nauthor.  \nThat said, the main principles of blockchain -\nbased governance could be summarized as follows:  \n \n(a) Centralized organizations and the problem \nof scale.  \nThroughout history, centralized political \norganizations like S tate, bureaucracy and \nrepresentative democracy have been a solution to a \nscaling problem. They have been mostly developed \nfor the purpose of reaching consensus and \ncoordination between heterogeneous or distant \ngroups of people, facilitating their mutual \ninteractions.  \n \n(b) State as a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).  \nAlthough they were built in response to specific \nhistorical necessities, organizations with top -down \ncentralized coordination and hierarchical structures \ntend to be inherently inefficient: they ar e based on \ncoercion and they may lack flexibility and capacity \nto evolve, providing inadequate responsiveness to \nchallenges and to the growing societal demands. In \nparticular, governments are proved to be \nsystematically exposed to significant risks, such a s \nlack of transparency, corruption, regulatory capture, \nmisuse of power and even regression into \nauthoritarianism, due to the concentration of power \nin the hands of few. Which leads to the classic \nmatter: quis custodiet ipsos custodes?  (Who will watch \nthe watchmen?).  \nA centralized authority in any hierarchical \norganization can be defined in computer terms as a \nSingle Point of Failure (SPOF) : if its functioning is not \noptimal, the whole system and its participants will \nbe negatively affected by it. Decentral ization aims to \nreduce or prevent such concentration of power and \nit is a fundamental condition for citizens to achieve \npolitical efficacy, equality, transparency, and \nfreedom.  \n \n(c) Distributed architecture and trust -by-\ncomputation: \u201cCode is law\u201d  \nCentraliz ed vertical authority has become the \nmain organizational model in society, simply \nbecause there has not been a better alternative so \nfar. For the first time in history, citizens can now \nreach consensus and coordination at global level \nthrough cryptographic ally verified peer -to-peer \nprocedures, without the intermediation of a third \nparty. The blockchain technology ushers in a new \nera of decentralization on large -scale, in which \nhuman factor is minimized and trust shifts from the \nhuman agents of a central org anization to an open \nsource code. In such distributed architecture, \u201ccode \nis law\u201d (Lessig, 1999; Farmer, 2003): the protocol is \nopen -source and it can be review by anyone; the \nnetwork is not owned nor controlled by any single \nentity; data are simultaneousl y kept by all nodes, \nthus ensuring proper redundancy. Neutrality of the \ncode, distributed consensus and auditability of \ntransactions can significantly reduce or overcome \nfrictions and failures inherent in decision -making \nprocess of centralized organization s (e.g. lack of \ntransparency, corruption, coercion, etc.). Many new \ndecentralized governance models and services can \ntherefore be implemented and experienced through \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n48 \nthe blockchain, without the oversight of \ngovernments (Swan, 2015).  \n \n(d) Power of individua ls and politics by instant, \natomic interactions.  \nWhile the State bases its action on coercion, the \nblockchain can provide governance services in a \nmore efficient and decentralized way, without \nhaving to relying on force. This allows a more \nhorizontal and d istributed diffusion of authority, in \nwhich the source of legitimacy are the individuals \nthemselves. Using the blockchain as a permanent, \nencryption -secured public record repository, \nhumans\u2019 agents as representatives can be replaced \nby smart contracts and Decentralized Autonomous \nCorporations (Swan, 2015). The collective \nrelationship between individuals and the State can \nbe fully or partially automated by instant, atomic \ninteractions (Buterin, 2014a). Under economic and \npolitical point of view, direct inter actions and \nconsensus -based models are more efficient than \npooled -models, since they can provide citizens with \na more representative and equitable way of \ninteracting with reality (Swan, 2015).  \n  \n(e) A do -it-yourself, Starbucks -style public \nadministration.  \nThe blockchain can be used as a permanent \npublic records repository to store all government \nlegal documents \u2013 such as contracts, identification \ncards, passports, lands deeds, etc. \u2013 in a cheaper, \nmore efficient and decentralized way. Any user -\ncitizen can c reate his own blockchain nation with an \nentirely voluntary, do -it-yourself -public \nadministration (Swan, 2015). Users can opt -in and \nout at will in accordance with their needs, so \ngovernment services can become more granular and \n\u201cindividualized as a Starbuc ks coffee orders\u201d (Swan \n2015, p. 46).  \n\u201cThrough simply downloading an app on your \nsmartphone, you can choose your code of law, your \npreferred arbitration method, write a smart contract, \nand get married, title your land, notarize a will, \nincorporate a compan y, get health insurance, and \nmuch more, in just a few minutes for a couple of \ndollars. It is backed by an ID and reputation system, \ndispute resolution, and an app library where people \ncan upload and share or sell their own do -it-yourself \ngovernance apps\u201d ( Bitnation -blog.com, 2015).  \n \n(f) Borderless, globalized government services.  \nBlockchain -based services are able to overcome \nthe geographical limits of nation states and uplift \ntheir jurisdiction to a global cloud (Swan, 2015). \nConsidering the growing mobili ty of individuals \nbetween borders, one overall provider of \ngovernment services is preferable to the current \nsystem, which is based on multiple nation states and \nis therefore inefficient (Swan, 2015).  \n \n(g) Systems of direct democracy.  \nDemocracy can become m ore effective through \nthe direct participation of citizens in the decision -\nmaking process. The blockchain technology can \nimplement new models of participation, such as  \nLiquid Democracy (http://liquidfeedback.org; Swan, \n2015) and random -sample elections.  \n (h) Futarchy: Voting for Values, While Betting On \nBelief.  \nFutarchy was proposed by economist Robin \nHanson (2003) as an engineering approach to public \npolicies. The system essentially consists on \nprediction market speculating and betting through \ncryptocurren cies and tokens. Citizens first vote on \nspecific political outcomes or targets, then on \nproposals for achieving them. Finally, they will gain \nor lose tokens, depending of the acceptance or \nrejection of proposals. Discussed as a new possible \ngovernance mode l based on Ethereum platform \n(Buterin, 2014b; Swan, 2015), futarchy represents \u201ca \nquintessential example of the potential \ntransformative power of blockchain technology\u201d \n(Swan 2015, p. 53).  \nAbout the role of State in the blockchain -based \ngovernance, positio ns are different and may include:  \n \n(i) A decentralized society still based upon the \nState authority.  \nTo decentralize services through the blockchain \ndoes not mean to dismiss the State, but to foster \nbetter governance. The blockchain is not meant to be \na tool for promoting lawlessness or anarchy: the \nobjective is rather to prevent the excessive \nconcentration of power in the hands of the few \n(Andreas Antonopoulos, interviewed by Sparkes, \n2014) and to make legal frameworks more granular \nand tailored to the nee ds of citizens (Swan, 2015).  \n \n(j) A new social contract, characterized by \nDecentralized Autonomous Societies and the final \ndemise of the State.  \nWith the diffusion of blockchain applications, it \nwill be finally possible for citizens to eliminate the \nneed fo r centralized institutions and design a new \nsocial contract based on consensus rather than \ncoercion, for a more transparent, autonomous and \ninnovative global society. The new social contract \nwould include systems for decentralized \ncommunication and collabo ration, as well as \ndecentralized arbitration systems in order to resolve \nconflicts through smart contracts, with rules \nconsented by the participants and compatible with \ncommon law or natural law  (letstalkbitcoin.com, \n2014; reddit.com, 2015).  \nIn the end, bl ockchain -based voluntary services \nwill be make the State completely irrelevant and it \nwill simply wither away because of lack of consent \n(Bitnation -blog.com, 2015). Society will be hence \ntransformed into a blockchain -based, self -\nsustainable system, run by algorithms and free -\nmarket rules.  \n\u201cI envisage a situation where governments \naren\u2019t necessary. That the free market will be able to \nprovide all the goods and services to secure your \nlife, liberty and property without having to rely on \ncoercion. That\u2019s where  this all ultimately leads. The \nend result is that governments will have less power \nthan free markets. Essentially, the free market will \nbe able to provide justice more effectively and more \nefficiently than the government can. If you think \nabout it, what i s the reason for government? It\u2019s a \nway of reaching global consensus over the theory of \nright and wrong, global consensus over who\u2019s guilty \nand who\u2019s innocent, over who owns what. They\u2019re \ngoing to be losing legitimacy as more open, \ntransparent systems are able to provide that \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n49 \nfunction without having to rely on force\u201d (Daniel \nLarimer, interviewed by Sparkes, 2014).  \n \n(k) Franchulates.  \nWith the full application of free market rules, \nthe blockchain technology may allow the emergence \nof franchulates, as in Neal Stephenson's novel Snow \nCrash (Swan, 2015). Franchulates are a combination \nof \u201cfranchise\u201d and \u201cconsulate\u201d. In Stephenson's \nbook, they consist of private corporations which \nhave replaced the State in all its functions, \ncompeting to each other to provide goo ds and \nservices. In this self -regulating society, the \nConstitution is disrupted and citizens have no \nrights; the State is reduced to a hollow entity with no \nreal power; private companies behave as government \nagencies, and citizenship is reduced to business  \nmembership and brand loyalty (Lipschutz, 2010). In \nthis anarchic -capitalist scenario, \u201cthe citizen -\ncostumer is king\u201d (Lipschutz 2010, p. 92).  \nThe blockchain technology has the potential to \ntransform our societies in something very similar to \nStevenson's v ision. For its advocates, the core idea is \nthat central institutions should not maintain the \nexclusive monopoly on government services: they \nshould rather act more as businesses, following \nmarket rules and offering value propositions and \nservices to the co stumer -citizens, as demanded by \nthe different segments of constituents (Swan, 2015).  \nFurther elements useful for discussion:  \n \n(l) Authority floating freely, cognitive dissonance \nand societal maturity.  \nDecentralization through the blockchain \ntechnology repr esents a \u201cnatural progression of \nhumanity\u201d (Andreas Antonopoulos interviewed by \nSparkes, 2014) and a \u201cnatural efficiency process\u201d \n(Swan 2015, p. 31). Nonetheless, it will take time for \nindividuals to fully understand and accept the \nprinciples of decentrali zation, and the process can \ncreate cognitive dissonance for those accustomed to \ntrust -based services (Andreas Antonopoulos, 2014). \nThe blockchain changes the way political \ngovernance, authority, independence and \nparticipation can be conceptualized and exec uted, in \nso forcing individuals to reach a new level of \nmaturity and understanding (Swan, 2015). Citizens \nhave always relied on an external, centralized \nauthority for government services, so it might be \ninitially difficult to accept a new model of \ngovernan ce only based on personal responsibility, \npeer-to-peer interaction and \u201cauthority floating \nfreely\u201d (Swan 2015, p. 54). Social maturity, however, \nwill possibly develop also in this context, as already \ndid in other industries such as information (Swan, \n2015) . \n \n3. THE BREAKDOWN OF THE STATE: AN \nHISTORICAL OVERVIEW",
    "Marxist Determinism and Anarcho -Capitalism": "3.1 Marxist Determinism and Anarcho -Capitalism  \n \nThe first consideration is that most of principles and \nassertions presented above are all but new in the \nhistory of modern political thought. The anti -\ngovernment rhetoric which often accompanies the \nblockchain advocates, as well as the idea to run \nsociety only through individual contracts is, for instance, at the very heart of Proudhon's social \ncontract \u2013 as explained in the General Idea of the \nRevolution i n the Nineteenth Century  (1851). But \nthere are also other similarities interesting to note.  \nThe strong individualism and the critic to \ncentralized, hierarchical organizations; the State \ndepicted as an outmoded instrument of oppression \nand the idea of coerc ion as a source of all evil; the \npossibility for individuals to finally govern \nthemselves, disrupting the current political \nparadigms;  and the gradual, spontaneous demise of \nthe state, once a vast majority of people will have \nreached a certain level of con sciousness \u2013 all these \nelements are rooted in the anarchic mainstream and \nin the determinism of the Marxist doctrine. \nAccording to Marxism, indeed, the State will not be \nsuddenly abolished, but it will simply \u201cwither away\u201d, \nonce certain conditions are met \u2013 in this case, when \nthe production processes will be reorganized by the \nworkers according to principles of freedom and \nequality. At which point, the Marxism claims that \n\u201call members of society, or at least a vast majority, \n[will] have learned to administe r the state \nthemselves \u201d, having reached a sufficient level of \nmaturity and political consciousness, and they \u201cwill \nput the whole state machinery where it will then \nbelong \u2013into the museum of antiquities, next to the \nspinning wheel and the bronze ax\u201d (Engels , 1884). \nWith a gradual and spontaneous process, citizens \nwill finally be accustomed to live in a society \n\u201cwithout force, without coercion, without \nsubordination, without the special apparatus of \ncoercion which is called the state\u201d  (Lenin 1917, p. \n42). \nThis seems to be exactly the ultimate purpose \nof crypto -anarchists \u2013 as well as an implicit desire of \nmany advocates of decentralization. In spite of these \ninteresting similarities, however, there is at least one \ncrucial difference here that should be noted. While \nfor Marxism the demise of the State is the natural \nconsequence of capitalism disruption, for the most \nfervent blockchain advocates it is rather the \nopposite: it represents the final victory of free \nmarkets and self -interested individuals over public \ninstitutions, in a process of economic liberalization \nwhich can be more properly defined as anarcho -\ncapitalism (Section II, point j, k).",
    "Decentralization and New Models of": "3.2 Decentralization and New Models of \nGovernance  \n \nWith reference to more recent political dynamics, \nthe drive towards  decentralization can be seen as a \npart of a wider anti -government phenomenon, which \nhas progressively emerged in Western democracies \nduring the last decades, modifying the relationship \nbetween citizens and central authority (Paquet & \nWilson, 2015). Accord ing to this new trend, different \ninterest groups in society are less inclined than \npreviously to compete against each other for the \ncontrol of the State: rather, they cease to recognize \nits political monopoly, emphasizing its weak \nperformance and failures,  and exploring new \npossibilities to organizing activities and services in a \nmore efficient way (Paquet & Wilson, 2015).  \nOver the last forty years, various models of \ndeliberative democracy and decentralized public \ngovernance have been developed to this aim,  and in \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n50 \nmany aspects the blockchain -based governance \nrepresents the latest development of this trend.  \nExpressing criticism against the limits of the \ntraditional forms of political participation, the \nconcept of deliberative democracy  has been \ndiscussed sinc e the 1980's as an ideal of political \nautonomy and self -governance. Based on the core \nprinciple that representative democracy should be \nenhanced by forms of direct civic participation, this \napproach has put particular emphasis on values \nsuch as public reas oning, deliberation among equal \ncitizens, transparency, and accountability of the \ndecision - making process (Bessette, 1980; Bohman & \nRehg, 1997).  \nAt the same time, the view of the State \nmonopoly as a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and the \nsearch for less s tate-centric policy instruments have \nalso paved the way to an increased interaction \namong public, private and nongovernmental \nsubjects for the fulfillment of public interest \nactivities. The notion of New Public Administration \u2013 \nand thereafter New Public Go vernance \u2013 has been \nproposed to define such new framework of \ndecentralized governing practices, emerged in the \nWestern countries since the 1970s. In this context, \nadvocates of a market -oriented approach to public \npolicies, such as Osborne and Gaebler (1992 ), have \nclaimed that governments should focus on \n\u201csteering\u201d rather than \u201crowing\u201d, setting priorities \nand goals instead of directly deliver services, in \norder to better meet citizens' needs. On one side, \nthese practices have addressed the growing need to \nexperiment an entrepreneurial model of leadership, \nfinding innovative solutions to the mismanagement \nof State and bureaucracy across the traditional \norganizational and institutional boundaries; on the \nother side, however, they have resulted in a \ncontroversia l and socially costly process of public \nexpenditure review, deregulation and \ncorporatization of public bodies, in the attempt to \nimprove efficiency and reduce costs of services \nthrough neo -liberal policies.  \nScholars have described as governance without \ngovernment  (Peters & Pierre, 1998; Rhodes, 1997) \nthis emerging pattern of management, characterized \nby a major shift of power from public to private \nsector, and by an increasingly dominant role of the \nmarket in public affairs. In this context, researchers \nhas also given particular emphasis to the power of \nnetworks to downplay the role of State and \ndominate public policy, due to ability of networks to \nself-organize, develop resilience and evade \ngovernment control (de Bruijn & ten Heuvelhof, \n1997; Kooiman, 1993;  Marsh & Rhodes, 1992; Peters \n& Pierre, 1998).  \nIn the last decade, the effects of globalization \nhave created new pressures on institutions for \nfurther decentralization and more participative \npolitical practices (Shabbir, Cheema & Rondinelli, \n2007). Control  and social coordination \u2013 which have \nalways been essential roles of the State \u2013 have \nbecome far more complex and fractured than in the \npast, now involving the sharing of authority with a \ngrowing number of non -state actors, operative \nagencies, stakeholders , and networks at local and \nglobal level. Concepts and practices of public \ngovernance have evolved accordingly and literature \nhas conceptualized a rich variety of new \norganizational models, with the discussion of multi -stakeholder (Freeman, 1984;  Almeida, Getschko & \nAfonso, 2015); decentralized (Shabbir, Cheema & \nRondinelli, 2007);  distributed  (Abbott, 2000; Paquet, \n2000); and  collaborative governance (Ansell & Gash, \n2008; Donahue, 2004). Although meanings and \ndefinitions of this model may change depending on \ncontext, they share some basic features, such as a \ntrend towards deconcentration of hierarchical \nstructures; a more responsive, transparent and \naccountable approach to decision -making; and the \ninclusion of multiple interest bearers in a platform \nof dial ogue, in order to find consensus -based \nsolutions to common problems.",
    "The Role of Cyberspace, Peer -To-Peer": "3.3 The Role of Cyberspace, Peer -To-Peer \nNetworks and Encryption  \n \nThe restless development of information technology, \nthe increasing digitization, and the ubiquitous \nnature of connectivi ty have represented a further \ncatalyst for governance decentralization. Eliminating \nthe barrier of communication costs and using a \ndistributed architecture with multidirectional \nconnections among all nodes, the Internet and \ncyberspace have allowed the emer gence of the \n\u201cnetworked public sphere\u201d (Benkler 2006, p. 212) as \na great facilitator of freedom of expression. Like \nnever before in history, citizens have had the \npossibility \u2013 among many other things \u2013 to intensify \ninteractions between interest groups and  social \nmovements at local and transnational level; express \ngrievances and discontent through non -institutional \nchannels; engage in new collaborative processes; and \nexperiment alternative governance models, in a \nclimate of greater political awareness, but also \ngrowing distrust of government actors.  \nAll these factors have contributed to a further \nerosion of the old concepts of Westphalian nation \nstate and territorial -based governance, with its \ntraditional functions related to sovereignty, \nauthority and natio nal boundaries increasingly \ncalled into question.  \nIn this context, even the diffused  enthusiasm \ntowards cryptography as a defensive political \ninstrument has certainly played a crucial role. The \nidea to use strong encryption to protect citizens' \nfreedom and  privacy from governments and big \ncorporations can be traced back to the cypherpunk \nand crypto - anarchist culture of the late 1970s. The \ncore principles of these heterogeneous \ncountercultural movements can be found in the \u201cThe \nCrypto Anarchist Manifesto\u201d (May, 1988) and in the \n\u201cCypherpunk's Manifesto\u201d (Hughes, 1993), stating \nthat freedom of speech, individual privacy in \ncommunication and anonymous transaction systems \nare essential conditions for an open society, and \nthey should be used to foster social and  political \nchange. Especially after September 11, these \nprinciples have led to a growing use of anonymity -\nprotecting peer -to peer networks (e.g. Freenet, Free \nHaven), capable to resist censorship and circumvent \nthe oppressive online mass surveillance syste ms put \nin place by governments and businesses (Farmer, \n2003).  \n \n \n \n \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n51 \n3.4. The Final Stage of Decentralization: the \nBlockchain -Based Governance.  \n \nAll the processes described so far have one major \ncommon thread: they have explored new forms of \ncoordination and interaction between State and \nsociety, with a significant shift of power from \ncentral institutions to individuals and/or markets. \nThe blockchain -based governance can be considered \nas the final stage of this process of decentralization \nand disempowerment of  institutions, insofar as:  \n- it proclaims the social benefits of a bottom -up \napproach to politics, emphasizing consensual \nforms of self -government and direct \nparticipation of citizens to decision -making \nprocess, in a similar way as deliberative \ndemocracy (an d other alternative models of \ngovernance);  \n- it fails to see any added value in central \ncoordination and it promotes the primacy of \neconomics over politics, following a logic of \nprivatization of government services, as \nprompted by the New Public Governance  \n(\u201cgovernments need to become more like \nbusiness; \u201cmarkets can do better than the \nState\u201d);  \n- it encourages the political use of strong \nencryption to enhance citizens' freedom and \nprivacy;  \n- it relies on peer -to-peer global networks and \nonline interest groups, wh ich aim to \ndecentralize hierarchical structures, be \nindependent as far as possible from government \npowers, and challenge their agenda.  \nThe final result is the idea that public policies \nand government services should be directly \nmanaged by private networks of individuals, through \na decentralized model of governance based on \ndistributed trust and market rules.  \nIn the next sections, we will discuss possible \npractical outcomes of this model.  \n \n4. DECENTRALIZING GOVERNMENT SERVICES \nTHROUGH THE BLOCKCHAIN: ISSUES AND  \nCONCERNS  \nTo which extent is it possible to decentralized public \nadministration and government services through the \nblockchain technology? Can we dismiss State \narchives, physical ledgers and human notaries, and \n\u201cput a nation on the blockchain\u201d? (Swan 2015 , p. 47).  \nUndoubtedly, the blockchain has remarkable \nproperties as a distributed ledger, such as efficiency, \ncost-effectiveness, irreversibility, transparency, \nauditability and censorship resistance. Yet, the \nproposal to decentralize government services \nthrough an open, unpermissioned blockchain entails \na whole set of unknowns, which may overweight the \nbenefits. Although the blockchain is frequently \ndescribed as a universal and permanent ledger, this \nclaim is somehow overstated, since it does not take \nenough  account of the way it is implemented and \nthe several performance risks at stake.  \n \n \n \n 4.1 Security Problems and Technical Weakness of \nCurrent Open Blockchains  \n \nThe first problematic aspect is that current public; \nunpermissioned blockchains as Bitcoin have a highly \nspeculative nature, with an inherent trade -off \nbetween dimension of the network and \ndecentralization. Scalability leads in fact to a natural \nprocess of centralization of the computing power in \nthe network, due to the decrease of the number of \nmine rs able to perform the mathematical verification \nrequired by the protocol, which has growing costs. \nBitcoin, for example, is currently run by increasingly \ncentralized mining farms, which turn out to be \nengaged in secretive, colossal mining operations in \nChina (Franco, 2015) or traded on the stock -\nexchange in Australia (Riley, 2015) with possible \nrisks of collusion or cartelization. Therefore, a \ndecentralized Starbuck -style governance (Section II, \npoint e) based on such a blockchain would \ndangerously expose citizens' records and essential \nrights to private interests and to unpredictable \nmarket dynamics (e.g. uncertainty of mining \nprofitability, volatility of prices, discontinuity of \ninvestments, speculative attacks, etc.).  \nMoreover, even if reliant on an appa rently \nrobust peer -to-peer network, a public blockchain is \ninherently volatile and it can be forked or dismissed \nby the community at any time, because not attractive \nor remunerative anymore. It is hence questionable \nwhether a fully decentralized blockchain  like Bitcoin \ncan be defined as a universal ledger. Since there is \nno guarantee that it will still be operative or even \nexist in the future, persistence and preservation of \ncontracts and government services may become \nsusceptible to invalidity because of   obsolescence, \nboredom, or shift towards a new system (DuPont & \nMaurer, 2015).  \nA further aspect of volatility is that data and \ncontracts recorded in the blockchain are entirely \nreliant on connectivity. In case the network is shut \noff, or the markets shift to a new, more appealing \ntechnology, there might be no paper -based backup \narchiving able to guarantee the existence of data or \nthe execution of contracts (DuPont & Maurer, 2015). \nAnd \u201ccontracts, by contrast, are all about managing \nuncertainty\u201d (DuPont & Ma urer, 2015).  \nThere are several other technical issues that \nshould be carefully assessed, when considering \nmigrating government services to an open, \nunpermissioned blockchain.  \nDespite the enthusiasm of its advocates, the \nscientific community generally agree s in stating that \nBitcoin and its many clones are based on a still \nimmature and highly vulnerable technology. A full \nanalysis of Bitcoin technical weaknesses falls beyond \nthe scope of this paper, but we will offer a brief \nsummary of the most relevant resea rches on this \ntopic.  \nConcerns have been raised, for instance, about \nthe incentive mechanism of Bitcoin mining protocol: \na research made by Ittay and G\u00fcn Sirer (2014) has \ndemonstrated that a colluding, minority group of \n\u201cselfish miners\u201d, consisting of 1/3 o f all miners of \nthe network, may in fact be able to strategically \ncontrol the system and break its decentralized \nnature. The research has therefore concluded that \nservices and data built on the top of the Bitcoin \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n52 \nblockchain, such as virtual notaries, are c urrently at \nrisk. \nAccording to the theory of Programmed Self -\nDestruction (Curtois, 2014), fatal engineering \nmistakes in the Bitcoin architecture will eventually \nresult in a process of programmed decline and self -\ndestruction. Problems outlined in this resea rch \ninclude:  \n- excessively fast erosion of profitability for \nexisting mining machines;  \n- enormous investments in hashing \ninfrastructure, still with poor general security of the \nsystem;  \n- insufficient network neutrality;  \n- lack of reliable data about the volume of \ntransactions and irrational expectations of investors.  \nIn particular, the self -destruction of Bitcoin \nnetwork could be caused by a fatal combination of \nfour factors:  \n- inefficiency of the longest chain rule, which \nleads to unnecessary instability and growing  \nrisks of attacks to the network;  \n- deflationary monetary policies;  \n- poor network neutrality and moral hazard;  \n- rapid hash power shifting from one coin to \nanother, due to high competition.  \nAlthough \u201cIn Cryptography We Trust\u201d is the \nmotto of many supporters aro und the world, \nresearches also show that Bitcoin blockchain \ncurrently suffers from major vulnerabilities related \nto the use of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), \nwhich include weak key generation, poor signature \nrandomness,  insufficient entropy and softwar e bugs \n(Bos, Halderman, Heninger, Moore, Naehrig et al., \n2014).  \nIn particular, Bitcoin elliptic curve \ncryptography is not quantum -safe and the \nemergence of quantum computers could disrupt it at \nany time. The National Security Agency has recently \nadmitted t he limits of ECC and the urgent necessity \nof migrating to post -quantum cryptography (iad.gov, \n2015), as also recommended by the renowned \ncryptographer Ralph C. Merkle (merkle.com). In this \nregard, Bitcoin core developers simply claim that \ngiven an appropri ate amount of advance warning \n(such as one month); they may be able to take \nemergency measures through a centralized authority \nand keep the blockchain safe. Centralization would \nbe introduced as temporary measure only and then \nretired after a few years (Bu terin, 2013). The \nproposal to fix technical problems through a central \nauthority or \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d, however, is \nclearly anti -democratic, since it entails the direct \npower of private  entities over government services \nand essential citizens' data, wit hout any formal \nlegitimacy nor control. Needless to say, history is \nfull of \u201cbenevolent dictators\u201d who bypassed \nprocedural legality and gave themselves full powers, \nwith the declared noble objective of serving the \ncommunity and restore order. But if histor y has \ntaught us anything, it is that the question of \nlegitimacy is crucial: it should hence be considered \nwith great care, especially by those libertarians who \ngenuinely believe in decentralization through the \nblockchain \u2013 and through Bitcoin in particular  \u2013 as a \nnew political model to enhance individual freedoms \nand collective rights.  In overall, the benefits of open, unpermissioned \nblockchains for government services seems to be \noffset by several risks, related to:  \n- moral hazard, scalability problems, tren d \ntowards centralization and likely dependency of \nnetworks on private oligarchies, such as miner \ncorporations, which may rapidly conduct stock \nexchange mergers and acquisitions, gaining \nconsiderable power on global scale;  \n- domination of market logic over es sential public \nservices and citizens' rights, which should be \nrather protected by speculations of any kind;  \n- possible lack of service continuity and /or \npreservation of data in the medium -long run \nwith no delineation of liability, due to market \ndynamics and /or serious technical flaws;  \n- raising of a dominant techno -elite with growing \nsupervisory powers over strategic services at \nglobal level, without the necessary formal \nlegitimacy.  \nWe should thus conclude that e -government \ncan hardly represent the best area o f applicability \nfor fully decentralized blockchains, such as Bitcoin. \nGovernment services require high performance and \nhigh degree of reliability, accessibility and \npredictability, being not tolerant of any service \ninterruption or failure: a flaw in the ma nagement or \nin the implementation of the network would \ncompromise the security and the civil rights of \nmillions of citizens. Moreover, a formal and \ntransparent process of legitimization must be \nstrictly required when dealing with government \nservices, in or der to avoid the indiscriminate \nemergence of private powers over public affairs.  \nCentralized and democratically legitimated \npublic institutions are therefore crucial to ensure \naccessibility for extremely sensitive data in the long \nrun and to preserve them from uncontrolled \ncentralization, market speculations, technical flaws, \nand private supervisory powers. On the contrary, an \nindiscriminate process of decentralization and \n\u201cgamification\u201d (DuPont & Maurer, 2015) of public \nadministration through token -based i ncentives  may \nturn out to be an irresponsible choice, with \ndetrimental effects on citizens' fundamental rights.",
    "Advantages Of Permissioned, Token -Less": "4.2 Advantages Of Permissioned, Token -Less \nBlockchains For Public Sector  \n \nIf open, unpermissioned blockchains like Bitcoin \nhave their own inher ent limits, permissioned \nblockchains may represent instead a valid solution \nfor e -government. Applications may include, for \nexample, the management of IDs and driving \nlicenses; land, school, medical records; certificates of \nbirth, marriage, and death; tamp er-proof and \nauditable e -vote systems; tax collection, and more.  \nPermissioned blockchains are replicated, \nshared ledgers (Gendal Brown, 2015), which can be \nadministrated by one or more organizations \u2013 e.g. a \ngovernment agency \u2013 in order to guarantee adequat e \nlevels of network coordination, reliability and \nsecurity through human intervention, when \nnecessary. These ledgers present advantages over \nboth fully distributed blockchains and traditional \ndatabases.  \nFirstly, they can be separated from speculative \nverification mechanisms, such as cryptocurrencies \nor token rewards: they can therefore be used for \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n53 \nservices that are of general interests only, with data \nproperly protected in the long term and no \ninterference from cryptocurrency markets.  \nSecondly, they are dis tributed and \nsynchronized, but their network is restricted to few \ntrusted nodes and members, identifiable by \ncontrolled access permissions. Since nodes are few, \nwith no need for neither mining nor computationally \nintensive proof - of-work , validations and p ropagation \nof data are much faster than public blockchains \n(Buterin, 2015). Networks are also substantially free \nof scalability issues and they are able to offer better \nperformance if compared to general purpose \nblockchains, since they are engineered for v ery \nspecific functionalities (Kuhlman, 2015).  \nPermissioned blockchain -based architectures \ncan be designed for specific purposes through \ndifferent consensus and verification systems, and \ndifferent levels of control, security, visibility and \npermissioning (P eters & Panayi, 2015).  \nTraditional databases are overall inefficient, \nsince they generally use a master -slave, centralized \nstructure for data replication. The master  database \nis the only original and authoritative source: any \nchange on data performed on th e master is \npropagated to the slave databases, which are kept \nsynchronized.  This kind of architecture, however, \nmay raise problems related to reliability, volume of \ntraffic, and latency, since the master database \nperforms all the writing operations. A more  \nadvanced system, called multi -master replication , \nallows any slave database to perform changes, \nsharing updates to each other to remain in sync \n(multichain.com, 2015). This entails, however, \ncomplex strategies to ensure data consistency, in \norder to preve nt and solve possible conflicts \nbetween information.  \nCompared to master -slave databases, the \ndistributed architecture of permissioned blockchains \nmay bring significant advantages to public \nadministration in terms of efficiency, data security, \ndata integrit y, availability, reduction of errors and \ninfrastructural costs. In particular, data integrity \u2013 \nwhich consists of data accuracy, consistency, \nprovenance and preservation through \ntransformation (Peters & Panayi, 2015) \u2013 is \nparticularly important for governm ent services, \nalong with security and availability, and it can be \nsignificantly enhanced by the blockchain technology.  \nAlthough they are still at an early stage of \ndevelopment, the advantages of permissioned \nblockchains should be definitely discussed more,  \nwith a view to a possible application in the public \nsector.  \nDespite their potential benefits, however, \npermissioned blockchains are often the target of a \ngreat deal of criticisms, mostly because they are \ncentralized, closed systems and they cannot provide  \ncensorship resistance. They can thus be resisted by \nthose techno -libertarians who view them as a threat \nto the process of decentralization, or as \u201ca desperate \nact of dinosaurish middlemen trying to stay \nrelevant\u201d (Buterin, 2015).  \nWe have already seen, how ever, that there are \nlimits to what public blockchains are suited for, and \nsuch limits should be clearly recognized, in order to \nmake reasoned choices.  \nIn regard with security, although the dominant \nnarrative tends to consider centralized institutions as incapable to rapidly react to sudden changes \n(Section II, point b), we can argue that the opposite is \nthe case: vertical centralization is definitely better \nsuited to deal with rapid technical challenges, \ncompared to horizontally -scaled structures. \nScalabil ity, for example, is a problematic factor. In a \ndistributed architecture with thousands or millions \nof nodes on global scale, to modify a protocol may \nresult in a complex and time -consuming procedure: \nit requires wide consensus of core developers, \nminers a nd nodes; consensus can be conditioned by \nreasons of economic expediency; and in the end, the \necosystem may fail to respond to unexpected \nchallenges in a timely fashion.  \nFor this very reason, we may conclude that \nthrough human use and intervention, complex  \nsystems of software have better chance to be \neffectively managed (DuPont & Maurer, 2015). When \ncitizens rights are concerned, however, it is worth \nrecalling that human agents cannot be hi -tech elites \nwho proclaim themselves benevolent dictators: they \nmust  rather be public officers legitimated through \nformal, accountable and transparent procedures.",
    "Government Services and the Technological": "4.3 Government Services and the Technological \nImperative of Decentralization  \n \nThe assumption that decentralization of services \nthrough the blockchain technology  represents an \ninescapable future or \u201ca natural progression of \nhumanity\u201d (Section II, point l) is common between its \nadvocates. Such approach, however, is sometimes \ntoo deterministic and it does not take enough into \naccount possible risks of implementation  in a \nspecific context of use.  \n Firstly, it is questionable that there is such a \nthing as a natural progression of humanity : rather, \nhumanity sets priorities and makes choices among \nmany possible options and scenarios, often in a \nconflicting way. It is als o questionable the idea that \nindividuals and societies can be forced by \ntechnology to grow into a new level of maturity \n(Section II, point l), since the success of a new \ntechnology depends much more on social factors \nand interactions than on the superiorit y of the \ntechnology itself, and in this regard every society \nhas different social practice, with unpredictable \ndynamics (Boersma, Meijer & Wagenaar, 2009).  \nThe idea that technological developments are \ninevitable, with fatal, unstoppable and irreversible \nconsequences on society,  is usually defined as \n\u201ctechnological imperative\u201d by scholars, and \ninterestingly, it tends to grow as technological \nsystems scale up and increase in complexity, \nbecoming more interconnected and interdependent \n(Chandler, 1995).  \nWhen de aling with essential government \nservices, however, determinism should never be the \ndriving force behind decentralization. Indeed, the \npoint is not to challenge the centralized model of \ngovernance at any cost, but to consider inherent \ntrade -offs of decentra lization within a specific \ncontext of use. While decentralization can be \nfunctional to good governance, it should not be \nregarded as an end in itself (Shabbir, Cheema & \nRondinelli 2007), nor uncritically embraced in the \nname of anti -government feelings, te chnological \nimperative or wish for innovation at any cost.  \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n54 \nIn this regard, it is also worth recalling that \ninnovation is \u201cthe specific tool of entrepreneurs\u201d \n(Drucker, 1985): as such, it generally belongs to a \nmarket -oriented vision of the world, which set s as \npriorities profit, competition and commercial \ninterests, but it does not necessarily represent the \nmost desirable characteristic for government \nservices, which are primarily connected to \npreservation of social, economic and political rights, \nand must rather prove security, reliability and long -\nterm durability, in the face of societal evolution.  \nDecentralization through open, token -based \nplatforms mostly means gamification of public \nfunctions, with the transformation of government \nservices and citizens rights into a new profitable \nprivate business. Given that today the new models of \ngovernance often proposed by exuberant political \nthinkers are increasingly transforming individual \nfreedoms into dangerous sources of insecurity \n(Marden, 2003), we should rec all the main reason \nwhy central coordination of public institutions was \noriginally created \u2013 and why we should keep it: to \nprotect common good and collective rights in the \nlong term from transitory individual interests and \nfrom any reckless logic of profit . And in this regard, \nit cannot be ignored that permissioned, token -less \nblockchains hold a considerable advantage over \npublic blockchains.  \n \n5. BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND THE \nSTATELESS GLOBAL GOVERNANCE  \nTo which extent can we consider blockchains and \ndecentral ization platforms as hyper -political tools , \ncapable to manage political interactions on large \nscale and dismiss any central authority, such as the \nState? Can we finally overcome traditional political \ninstitutions and make a new social contract only \nbased o n decentralized platforms, distributed \nconsensus, and \u201cauthority floating freely\u201d (Section II, \npoint  j, l)? \nWe will discuss reasons why such scenario is \nnot only problematic, but also undesirable.",
    "Technocratic Reasoning and the Triumph of": "5.1 Technocratic Reasoning and the Triumph of \nHomo Economi cus \n \nThe first objection is that the role of governments, \npolitics and representative democracy cannot be \nreduced to a web of instant atomic interactions, \nentirely executable by automated processes (If X, \nThen Y). This engineering approach to social \ndynami cs promoted by technology vendors and \ndecentralized platforms developers ( Section II,  \npoints  d, h ) as a way to overcome traditional \npolitical institutions  is a clear example of \ntechnocratic reasoning and determinism \u2013 which \nscholars claim to be deeply embe dded in all Western \nmodern societies and particularly in the American \nculture (Smith & Marx, 1994).  \nTechnologists tend to overemphasize the \nefficiency of encryption and codes as political tools, \ncapable to verifying and aggregating individual \ndecisions on large scale without intermediaries. \nAdmittedly, the blockchain technology can greatly \nimprove structure, management and decision \nmaking process of specific realities, making them \nless dependable on top -down coordination.  Human and social communities, howe ver, are highly \ncomplex systems, with unpredictable and non -linear \nconnections between parts, and no obvious \nendpoints (Allenby, 2012). The capacity to \nunderstand the world in all its complexity is context -\nsensitive, and it must entail a strong ethic \ndimen sion, as well as a direct human participation. \nGovernance is therefore much more than \naggregating votes, keeping databases in sync, \ncalculating metrics or enforcing transactions \nthrough algorithms. Politics cannot be simplistically \nreduced to binary codes,  since it is an art that stems \nfrom the ethic sphere of human beings and it \nbelongs to them exclusively, as creatures \u201cendowed \nwith reason and conscience\u201d (Art.1 of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights). We must hence guard \nagainst the risk of a gross  oversimplification of \ncomplexity and the indiscriminate application of \nautomatic procedures. C ode developers, for \nexample, tend to reduce any  human organization to \nthe mere combination of two elements: a set of \nproperty, and a set of individuals who follo w a \nprotocol (Buterin, 2014a), which can therefore be \nautomatized. This reductionist approach, however, \nis unmindful of the cultural, social, institutional, and \nethical complexity of human interactions, and  it may \neasily lead to a technological dystopia, i f protocols \nprevails in the way we interact.  \nWe must not forget that empathy and \nconscience, for example, are irreplaceable \ncomponents of any social and political interaction, \nand information efficiency  and automation are not \nnecessarily the ultimate purpo se of human \ncommunities.  \nFar from any real political dimension, the \nregression of the concept of democracy to  \ngovernance -by-computation or Decentralized \nAutonomous Organizations  \u2013 namely large scale \nautomated procedures devoid of life as exclusive \nway of interacting \u2013 would represent the ultimate \ntriumph of Homo Economicus:  an agent renowned \nfor being \u201cautonomous, instrumentally rational, \npsychologically self -sufficient, 'under socialized' and \nmotivated into action by the utilitarian principle of \nmaximizing  pleasure \u201d (Bourque, Harrisson & Sz e\u0301ll \n2009, p. 85). In addition, with the bad reputation of \n\u201canthropological monster\u201d (Bourdier, 1997).",
    "The Pre-Political Dimension of a": "5.2 The Pre-Political Dimension of a \nBlockchain -Based Society and the Meaning of the \nState  \n \nIn order to better unders tand the possible dynamics \nof a stateless and algorithm -based society, it can be \nuseful retread the logical process of creation of the \nState according to the natural law theorists, as \noutlined by Bobbio (1995).  \nIn a hypothetical, fully decentralized societ y \nrun through smart contracts, Decentralized \nAutonomous Organizations  and market rules, \nindividuals live in a kind of pre -sovereignty \ncondition: on a case -by-case basis, they self -organize \nand cluster around common needs and interests, \nwhich they try to ad ministrate or secure through \nconsensus - based automatized procedures, accepted \nby the parties involved. For example, they may use \ndecentralization platforms to manage distribution of \nresources, run reputation -based systems or organize \nany kind of services through crowd -funding.  \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n55 \nSo why such a society is all but perfect?

This phase in which individuals reach \nconsensus and set standards for a common, \npeaceful living is usually called pactum societatis  by \ncontractarian doctrines.  \nThis non -aggression pact can be gained \nthrough consensus and represents a form al move \nfrom the state of nature towards the establishing of \ncivil society. And nonetheless, as Bobbio recalled, \nreaching consensus is not sufficient and it does not \nsolve conflicts : indeed, the observation of this pact is \nnot ensured in any way and it is not protected from \nexternal, opposing forces. As a result, society is still \nquite unstable, dispersed and agonistic.  \nIn the end, the natural need of security and the \nnecessity to avoid fragmentation of social efforts \nlead individuals to establish a permane nt point of \ncontrol, a neutral Third Party to which delegate the \nresponsibility of maintaining order, coordinate \nactivities and resolve future conflicts in a legitimate \nway, through a pactum subjectionis (or submission to \norganized coercion). That moment i s crucial and \nmarks the emergence of the idea of State, which can \nbe deemed as a product of logical thought \u2013 as also \nKant claimed \u2013 rather than an historical event. Most \nimportantly, the symbolic phase in which the general \nwill is created marks the move o f human \ncommunities to a real political dimension, in which a \nhigher level of coordination between conflicting \ninterests is recognized as fundamental, in order to \nprotect consensus once reached.  \nIt is this juridical and ethic process that \ntransforms indivi duals into citizens . \nMany techno -libertarians claim that central \ncoordination and State are the products of a \npatriarchal, hierarchical and gerontocratic mindset \nthat we ought to overcome. The principles behind \ndecentralization often echo the values of neo -liberal \npolitics and individualism, with an emphasis on \npersonal responsibility, self -promotion, self -\ngovernment, and control over one's destiny (Marden, \n2003), as opposed to top - down policies, \npaternalistic central institutions, and \u201cfaceless \ngovernment  bureaucrats\u201d. In this regard, however, it \nis worth recalling that central political institutions \nhave emerged through a complex, historical process \nof emancipation from private powers and churches, \nsetting legitimate procedures not only to overcome \nproble ms of scale or to coordinate distant groups \n(Section II,  point  a), but most of all to protect \ngeneral consensus, execution of the laws and the \nindividual rights themselves from the inevitable \nchaos of antagonistic interests.  \nIt is therefore clear that the State, as a \nguarantor of fundamental rights, is not an unwieldy third party that can be by -passed through a \ntechnological disintermediation process: the State is \nus, as a result of the first and biggest crowd -funded \nproject ever existed in history, and it should not be \ndefined in opposition to civil society. Far from being \nover, this collective project is rooted in our \nConstitutions and it is connected to the concepts of \npublic interest, citizens' rights, coordination and \nredistribution of resources, which cannot be entirely \ndevolved to market laws or atomized algorithm -\nbased interactions.  \nWe certainly agree that human society must be \ncreative, developing a diversified ecology through \nbottom -up governance models to better approach its \nproblems. Nonetheless, we should also be aware of \nthe pitfalls of a technicist attitude, recognizing that \nautomation and decentralization have inherent \nlimits and new forms of social and political fragility \nmay stem from them.  \nIn this regard, it is not clear, for example, how \na fully distributed, blockchain -based society would \nregulate conflicts, mediate between opposite \ninterests, or rectify social iniquities, other than \nthrough market adjustments, complex webs of \nsmart contracts or other sophisticated, automated \nincentive mecha nisms. Not only markets are proven \nto be incapable of creating social justice and \nredistribution \u2013 in spite of what techno -\nentrepreneurs may claim (Section II, point j) \u2013 but it \nis rather the subjugation of politics to \u201cturbo -\ncapitalism\u201d and its financial dictates that bears most \nof the responsibility for the problems currently \naffecting our democracies \u2013 from long term \nunemployment, poverty, regulatory capture and \nerosion of social capital, to imperialist wars, \ndiffused insecurity and fear (Luttwak, 1999; Ziegler, \n2002).  \nIn fact, it is with the increasing atomization of \nsocial life, the extreme individualism and the \nrestless rationalization of economic structures that \ncorporate power reinforces and reproduces itself, to \nthe detriment of individual and colle ctive rights \n(Boggs, 2000; Marden, 2003).",
    "Stateless Global Society and \u201cAmoral": "5.3 Stateless Global Society and \u201cAmoral \nAntipolitics\u201d: The Disempowerment of \nCitizens  \n \nThe major problem of an hypothetical global society \nonly run through organizational patterns based on \nindividualism \u2013 namely Decentralized Autonomous \nOrganizations,  free market rules, and \u201cauthority \nfloating freely\u201d (Section II, point l) \u2013 is that it would \nessentially lack legitimate mechanisms to regulate \nthe convergence of the particular into the general, \nwhich is the traditio nal role of centralized political \ninstitutions. Breaking the collective identity building, \ncitizens may not see themselves anymore as a part \nof a whole, because the general will is replaced by a \nmyriad of immediate acts of the individual will. This \nmay ent ail a serious risk of regression of human \ncommunities into a pre -political condition, \ncharacterized by \u201cHobbesian deregulated landscapes \nand a retreating State\u201d (Marden 2003, p. 90). \nIndividuals would not be citizens anymore, but mere \nservice consumers and  players, \u201cindependent \ninterest -bearers ... with no agreed -upon norms to \nregulate their interactions as free and equal beings\u201d \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n56 \n(Urbinati 2006, p. 65); and society would be \ndominated by adversarial private interests and \n\u201cfranchulates\u201d \u2013 as described by Step henson in his \nnovel (Section II , point  k).Such a scenario falls within \nthe concept of amoral antipolitics (Schedler 1997; \nMarden 2005): the lines between public and private \naction are blurred and politics is reduced to a \nprivate, strategic power game of homo economicus, \nbased solely on rational choice principles and aimed \nto maximizing the utility of participants.  \nWhether it is moved by misguided libertarian \nintentions, na ive utopians or investors seeking for \nprofit, the idea to create a stateless global so ciety \nthrough an indiscriminate proliferation of private \ndecentralized platforms seems to be far from ideal: \nsuch a system would not go indeed beyond the \nprimitive phase of pactum societatis, characterized \nby conflicts between many different consensus -\nbased groups and oligarchies, in the general absence \nof mechanisms to enforce citizens' rights and \nfreedom. Contrary to the claims of some blockchain \nadvocates, the final outcome would be the general \ndisempowerment of individuals, the \u201cdeification of \nthe marke t and the triumph of antipolitics\u201d (Marden, \n2003, p. 185). These conclusions, however, hardly \ncome as a surprise: in discussing technological \ndeterminism and utopianism as peculiar historical \ntraits of American society, Segal (1985) suggests that \ntechnolog ical utopias generally lack effective \nsolutions in terms of social cohesion and real social \nprogress. And the deterministic applications of \nblockchain technology to politics appear to bear this \nout. \n \n6. THE MYTH OF AN EGALITARIAN BLOCKCHAIN -\nBASED SOCIETY  \nTech no-libertarians usually place particular \nemphasis on blockchain capability to reach \nconsensus between participants on large scale, \nconsidering vertical political authority detrimental \nto individual powers. They often advocate the \nwishful scenario of a flat , non - hierarchical and \ncoercion -less society run through algorithm -based \nconsensus, in which individuals can cooperate freely. \nThis vision, however, seems to come in addition to \nthe number of many others ICTs myths emerged in \nthe last decades \u2013 including for instance \u201cthe myth \nof a new and a better government\u201d, \u201cthe myth of the \nrational information planning\u201d, and \u201cthe myth of the \nintelligent and empowered consumer\u201d (Bekkers & \nHomburg, 2009).  \nWe will briefly discuss reasons why the \nblockchain governance as political model does not \nsolve neither the problem of coercion, nor the \nproblem of hierarchic structures in society.",
    "The Issue of Coercion": "6.1 The Issue of Coercion  \n \nIn the rhetoric of decentralization, consensus  and \ncoercion  have become concepts related to opposite \nmodels of social and political organization. By \nsemantic association, the word consensus  seems to \nevoke principles such us equality, fairness, \nagreement, brotherhood, cooperation, pacification. \nOn the contrary, both the words centralization  and \ncoercion  seem to be r elated to the idea of constrain, \noppression, violence, lack of freedom, infringement of natural, individual rights. This perspective, \nhowever, is quite objectionable. It does not take into \naccount, for instance, that centralization and \ncoercion are legal m eans originally designed to gain \nstability, protection of individual rights and long -\nterm cohesion between groups. To see coercion \nsolely as an instrument of oppression is another \ntypical element of anarchic and Marxist doctrines: \naccording to this view, t he individual autonomy is to \nbe considered a supreme value and there is no \ndifference between force of authority based upon \nthe law and mere violence.  \nAt theoretical level, however, modern Western \nconstitutions have already solved the problem of \nfinding a balance between centralized, coercive \npower and individual rights, through the concept of \nrule of law: coercion based upon the law is thus \nsource of rights for citizens, and of not only duties, \nand it constitutes the necessary common ground \nbetween liberal ism and democracy.  \nExamining the fundamental assumptions of \ndemocratic theory, Robert Dahl (1989) explained \nthat anarchists considers the coercive authority as \nan undesirable model, which should be replaced by \nvoluntary associations based on continuing con sent. \nToday, a strong anti -government feeling and \ntechnological determinism lead many crypto -\nanarchists and techno -libertarians to believe in the \nblockchain as a disruptive technology capable to \ngain such continuing consent , in order to create a \nsociety wi th horizontal structures and distributed \nauthority.  \nDahl, however, proposed many valid theoretical \npoints which contradict these assumptions. Firstly, if \nwe judge the performance of political systems as \ngood or bad according to the extent to which they \nminimize coercion and maximize consent, then we \nare dealing with moral  doctrine and not with \npolitical philosophy. However, most importantly, \nsince coercion is indeed a moral problem, it does not \ndisappear with the demise of the State,  nor with a \nhorizontal d istribution of authority. Coercion will \ncontinue to exist even in the absence of the State, \nsimply because there will always be recalcitrant \nwrongdoers in society; moreover, even if democratic \ninstitutions were dismantled, some associates could \nalways gain  enough resources to create an \noppressive State.  \nSince the continuous consent is in practice \nimpossible and coercion responds to an unavoidable \nmoral problem, all that remains is to decide how and \nwhen the use of coercion is justifiable, according to \ndemoc ratic rules.  \nShowing that the problem of coercion is all but \nsolved by the absence of the State, Dahl leads us \nback again to the inescapable problem of setting a \nhigher level of political coordination, with legitimate \nprocedures to achieve organized coerci on \u2013 as \ndiscussed earlier. But this does not have to be a \nnegative thing per se. As Dahl rightly pointed out, \navoiding coercion cannot be considered as a \nsupreme goal, which should prevail on other ends \nlike security, freedom, justice, or happiness: indeed , \nit is not superior to such values at all.  \nWe can thus conclude that in the democratic \ntheory, noncoercion, just like decentralization, \ncannot be regarded as a political end in itself.  \n \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n57",
    "The Emerging of New Hierarchies: the": "6.2 The Emerging of New Hierarchies: the \nBlockchain Governance Oligar chy \n \nA part from the issue of coercion, the blockchain -\nbased governance is not likely to solve the problem \nof social hierarchical structures either.  \nDespite the open source nature of protocols \nand the much -vaunted egalitarianism of peer -to-peer \nnetworks, a  massive adoption of blockchain services \nwith no public institutions to coordinate their action \nwould most probably end up creating new \noligarchies and a strong polarization in society. In \nvirtue of their technical skills, code developers, \nminers, fintech professionals and technopreneurs \nwould easily have a privileged position in society, \nbecoming the new policy makers to detriment of a \nbig mass of computer illiterate or low skilled \nindividuals, reduced to mere passive recipients of \nservices. Elites can ass ume many forms according to \nthe social and political context, and we are in a \nphase of human development where the power to \ndevelop codes and select algorithms has \u2013 and it will \nincreasingly have \u2013 major implications in \ncontemporary society: this power ent ails \u201cassertion \nof authority\u201d (Musiani, 2013) and it constitutes \n\u201cpolitics pursued by other means\u201d (Latour 1988, p. \n229; Musiani, 2013), calling into question the \negalitarian nature of technology and networks. \nRegrettably, indeed, open source  does not \nautomatically mean neither equal opportunity, nor \ninclusiveness. Since such networks present major \ncognitive entry barriers, the issue of accessibility \nand digital divide is still the greatest obstacle to any \ntechnology -based cosmopolitan governance (Marden, \n2003).  \nAccording to many observers, a tendency to \nelitism and centralization is already observable in \nthe current state of Bitcoin network, and similarly in \nother decentralized platforms. In theory, the open \nsource protocol is designed to foster cooperation  on \nglobal scale and anyone can contribute to code \ndevelopment through an online forum (github.com). \nIn practice, however, decisions are executed by a \nsmall number of core developers and they constitute \na governance group with the exclusive power to \naccept  submissions (Gasser, Budish & West 2015). \nUsers remains free to opt in or opt out at will, with a \nconsensus ex -post policy  that is only a shrunken \nversion of democratic governance, because of its \npassive nature.  \nGervais, Karame, Capkun and Capkun (2013) \nhave exposed the lack of transparent decision \nmaking in Bitcoin and its centralized nature, \nemphasizing the privileged position of core \ndevelopers in conflict resolution and the emergence \nof many profitable businesses, mostly related to \nmining operations. W hile the community generally \nbelieves that no entity will ever acquire enough \ncomputing power to control the network, miners \ndominate the market and the fate itself of Bitcoin, \nsince their power far exceeds the one of individuals \n(Gervais, Karame, Capkun &  Capkun, 2013).  \nAlso Curtois (2014) warned about the existing \nimbalances in the Bitcoin ecosystem, both from a \ntechnical and economic point of view. Bitcoin \nstakeholders \u2013 to name but one example \u2013 generally \nlack essential information about security issues , \nbecause there is a strong asymmetry in information \nbetween core developers, pool managers and users. Further, Curtois confirmed that the design of the \nentire Bitcoin architecture always gives mining pool \noperators a greater strategical power in decision \nmaking, compared to nodes. But most importantly, \nCurtois stressed that open communities tend to \naggregate into clusters: sub -communities of Bitcoin \nenthusiasts, well -established service providers and \nother influential stakeholders interested in \npromoting t heir brand name and their business \ninterests, for instance, tend to set up an \nauthoritative power, especially if there are major \neconomic interests at stake.  \nThe most compelling evidence of this is \nperhaps Bitcoin XT,  a much criticized hard fork \nlaunched i n August 2015, for which the Bitcoin \nFoundation took upon itself the power of decision \nover global policy strategies (Hayase, 2015). Albeit \nnot formally vested with centralized decisional \npowers, Bitcoin Foundation is endowed with a \nformal structure and le gal obligations, and \naccording to global governance researchers, this has \nled to \u201can increased significance of voting\u201d in the \ndecisional process (Gasser, Budish & West 2015, p. \n20). \nIf foundations or similar institutions may \nachieve a significant and unacc ountable soft power \nin decentralized ecosystems, there is also a number \nof prominent individuals in the Bitcoin and \nblockchain industry, which have a strong influence \non the community and its discussions \n(coindesk.com, 2015). This elite group may consist \nof startup founders, key executives, chief scientists \nand evangelists, who easily make headlines for their \nleading role in technical debate. These celebrities \ngenerally gain charismatic power through a strong \nvisibility in international conferences and medi a, by \nvirtue of their technical and rhetoric skills, or \nbecause of their reputation as big private investors. \nIn this kind of global theathrocracy  \u2013 as Plato would \nsay  \u2013  grounded on online and stage presence, by \nacting as industry thought leaders, they b ecome \nleaders de facto , promoting their ideas on how the \nindustry should move forward, and using financial \npower, technical skills and persuasion \u2013  namely \n\u201cinfluence over beliefs\u201d (Dahl 1989, p. 274) \u2013 as \nmeans of hegemony. This Steve Job -style charismati c \npower can strategically use information to steer \nnetwork policy or shape users consensus at global \nlevel.  \nWhile the good faith of these public figures is \ngenerally taken for granted, it is significant that they \nmay have previously had high -rank careers i n IT or \nfinancial giants, such as Google or JP Morgan. Is the \nglobal financial techno -elite exploring new profitable \ngeographies of capital, joining the cause of \ndecentralization? In addition, if so, with what \npolitical aim in view? Whatever the answer is,  the \nrevolving door  issue may raise legitimate concerns, \nbeing potentially harmful to the public interest, \nespecially in case of massive adoption of the new \ntechnologies at stake.  \nConsiderations made so far may as well apply \nfor crowd -funded decentralized platforms like \nEthereum, a token -based service from which \ndepends the execution of smart contracts and other \napplications. Ethereum is developed by a worldwide \nteam of contributors called ETHDEV, through GitHub \nplatform. The platform is run on behalf of th e \nEthereum Foundation, a non -profit organization \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n58 \nregistered in Switzerland, and its centralized \nstructure consists of a Board of Directors and an \nExecutive Chief. Albeit functional to the \ndevelopment of the platform, Ethereum model of \ngovernance is founded  on ownership and vertically \nstructured power: this inevitably raises the issue of \nlegitimacy, integrity of the management team and \nadequate transparency in the mechanisms for \nreviewing development proposals, especially when \ndealing with citizens' essentia l services. In a world \nincreasingly reliant on technology and ruled by \nnetworks, whoever owns and controls these \nplatforms will always have a significant power over \ncivil society on a global scale.  \nElitist theorists like Gaetano Mosca (1884; \n1896) claimed that any socio -political regime is \nalways ruled by an organized minority. The \nexamples discussed so far confirm that even \ncyberspace and open networks have an inherent \nelitist nature, in which debate and decisions still \ntend to be dominated by few. Indeed,  networks \nbased on distributed consensus are far from having \na homogeneous and egalitarian structure: despite \nthe incorruptible nature of algorithms, individuals \nare inclined to form clusters based on similar \ninterests and networks are thus likely to prese nt \nsubtle or hidden points of control, other directly \nmanaged by core developers or indirectly shaped by \ndiffused, charismatic powers.  \nAll these elements confirm that the \nrevolutionary potential of governance - by- network  \nas an absolute, perfectly horizont al mode of political \nand social organization is often overstated and \nunrealistic \u2013 as van Dick and Winters -van Beek \n(2009) already pointed out. Networks are never \nbased exclusively on pure cooperation, on the \ncontrary they have their own centralized modes of \nsteering and governance, without which they easily \nrisk to fall apart (van Dick & Winters -van Beek, \n2009).  \nDespite any utopian vision about a blockchain -\nbased, horizontal distribution of authority in society, \nhierarchies, markets and networks constitute  the \nthree main components of any society and they will \nalways exist, restlessly competing against each other \nfor power (Aron 1965; van Dick & Winters -van Beek, \n2009). In the end, these very dynamics prevent both \nutopias and dystopias to become real (van D ick & \nWinters -van Beek, 2009).  \nBut since a mix of centralization, \ndecentralization and competition for power appears \nto be inevitable in society, resisting any disruptive \ninformation technology, we are back again to the \nproblem of selecting leaders through  legitimate \nprocedures, defining transparent and accountable \nmechanisms to limit their power. An issue that the \ngovernance of open blockchains leaves unresolved, \npromising instead a utopian and universal socio -\npolitical levelling.  \n \n7. THE BLOCKCHAIN -BASED GOV ERNANCE AS AN \nORGANIZATIONAL THEORY. CONCLUSIONS  \nThe blockchain is a disruptive technology with a \ntremendous transformative potential for our \nsocieties. Risks and benefits related to its possible \napplications, however, must be carefully weighted, \navoiding utopian expectations, as well as the pitfalls \nof technocratic reasoning and determinism.  If properly managed, decentralization of \ngovernment services through permissioned \nblockchains is possible and desirable, since it can \nincrease public administration fu nctionality. \nDecentralization of governance through open, \ndistributed blockchains like Bitcoin, however, \npresents serious risks and drawbacks, which offset \nthe benefits.  \nAlthough originally designed as \ndisintermediation tools, the ecosystems of fully \ndistr ibuted blockchains are characterized by a great \namount of third parties and profitable businesses \noffering intermediation services, with strong \nasymmetries of information and power between \ndevelopers and users. Trend towards centralization, \ndigital divide,  lack of transparency in decision \nmaking process, and unaccountable power of core \ndevelopers \u2013 all these factors call into question the \negalitarian nature of current open networks, making \nsome blockchain advocates' expectations \noverestimated and unrealisti c. In particular, the idea \nof a blockchain -based authority that \u201cfloats freely\u201d \n(Section II, point l) turns out to be deceptive, since \nauthority is in fact proven to morph into more \nsubtle or hidden centralized forms: while this kind \nof governance is accep table for business and private \nservices \u2013 since inequalities and relativism are \ntypical of markets \u2013   it is clearly unsuitable for e -\ngovernment, because of its very antidemocratic \nnature.  \nThere are hence reasons to question the role of \nthe blockchain -based governance as a great \nfacilitator of individual power, in an absolute sense. \nOn one hand, the promise of empowering \nindividuals is likely to remain unfulfilled, because of \nthe dominant role of markets and the speculative \nverification systems of fully dis tributed blockchains. \nOn the other hand, the process of downplaying \npublic institutions, the primacy of economics over \npolitics, and the transformation of citizens into \ncostumers with the promise of more freedom, \nefficiency, and equality may hide yet anoth er \ninsidious process of corporatization of politics, \nwhich invariably empowers markets to the detriment \nof citizens. Far from being new, such shift of power \nfrom public to private sector has been ongoing in \nvarious forms for decades, with huge social and \neconomic costs.  \nInsofar as  the State is not recognized as a \nnecessary collective body, it is weakened or mostly \ndissolved in economy; a new elite of code developers \nwith unaccountable power reduces politics to \nelectronic service delivery; citizens are mere \nconsumers of services provided by private \nplatforms; collective rights \u201cfloat freely\u201d, treated like \nany other commodity; and betting digital tokens on \npublic policies is extolled as \u201ca quintessential \nexample of the potential transformative power of \nblockch ain technology\u201d (see futarchy , Section II, \npoint h); then all the libertarian rhetoric against \npolitical hierarchies and the narrative constructed \naround blockchain decentralization risk to come \ndown to a hi -tech, anarcho -capitalist paradigm, the \nnature of  which is deeply anti -democratic.  \nA reasonable conclusion is that the blockchain -\nbased governance should be seen as an \norganizational theory  \u2013 with significant technical \nand managerial advantages for markets, private \nservices, communities, and e -government  itself \u2013 \nJournal of Governance and Regulation / Volume 6, Issue 1, 201 7 \n \n \n59 \nwhile it is not meant to be a  stand -alone political \ntheory. Likewise , blockchain technology and \ndecentralized platforms are not hyper -political , but \nrather pre-political  tools. If not balanced out by the \nfunctions of centralized, democratic insti tutions, the \nblockchain -based governance risk falling within the \nconcept of amoral antipolitics, justified by the \nrhetoric of inevitability of globalization, free -market \nand individual power (Marden, 2003). And these \nantipolitical forces are able to disrup t those very \ndemocratic values that today many libertarians \nstrive to defend.  \nWhen assessing risks and benefits of \nblockchain applications, we cannot overlook the fact \nthat to overthrow the State and to absorb its \nfunctions is a profitable business. While the \nblockchain was originally created to eliminate the \nneed of a third party in transactions, the paradox is \nthat stakeholders now involved in blockchain \ngovernance play the classical role of tertius gaudens \n(Simmel 1908; Portinaro, 1986), a \u201crejoicing thi rd\u201d \nthat attains economic benefits  by replacing the State \nin some or all its functions; even worse, these agents \nmay also intentionally pursue a strategy of divide et \nimpera  (divide and rule) between civil society and \nState, aimed to undermine the traditio nal democratic \norder, modify the existing balance of power and \nachieve a dominant position in society.  If it is true \nthat \u201cthe neo -liberal ascendancy and its corporate \nagenda are producing its own version of democracy\u201d \n(Marden 2003, p. xiv), it is not unr easonable to \nassume that this will take on the features of an \nalgorithm -based decentralized society.  \nIn such scenario, to advocate the idea of State \nmeans to reaffirm the primacy of politics over \neconomics and to recognize the need for a \ncoordination point  in society, in which the tensions \nbetween individual interests and common good find \na constructive, political compromise. Needless to \nsay, this in no way means to defend the current \ndeplorable degeneration of public institutions into \nmass surveillance sys tems, nor to justify the \nreduction of politics to a \u201cculture of security\u201d, which \nis increasingly transforming citizens into public \nenemies. On the contrary, it means to revert to the \noriginal spirit of our Constitutions and to their \ngenuine democratic prin ciples, so often perceived as \nan encumbrance by political practice.  \nIt is the conscientious application of principles \nand rights enshrined in law that can really empower \nindividuals \u2013 rather than the privatization of \ngovernment services through token -based  open \nplatforms. As Dahl (1989) rightly pointed out, \nimproving governance and seeking the best, State is \nthe only reasonable way to maximize individual \nautonomy. There is no reason why blockchain \napplications should not be functional to these goals, \nand de ployed within a democratic institutional \nframework.  \nWhile the strong public dissent of techno -\nlibertarians and cypherpunks against institutions is \nhonorable, for it brings the problem of arbitrary use \nof power into focus, now more than ever the State \nand t he constitutional provisions must be carefully \nuncoupled from the long history of misuse of power \nperpetrated by state rulers (Urbinati, 2003); in other \nwords, the theoretical principles of the State must \nnot be confused with bad governance, corrupted \npoliticians or defective politics.  The major challenge for global civil society will \nsoon be to explore new political and social \ndimensions, with the aim of integrating the \napplications of disruptive technologies such as the \nblockchain with citizens' rights, e quality, social \ncohesion, inclusiveness, protection of public sector, \nand our established democratic principles.  \nSuch integration is vital and cannot be left to \nthe (anti -) political engineering of IT experts, \nfinancial investors, and code developers: it r equires \nindeed a mature and interdisciplinary effort by all \nthe fields of human knowledge, with particular \nregard to political theory, humanities and social \nsciences, to best assess risks, benefits and outcomes \nof the new technologies.  \nIn the very next fut ure, this integration might \nbe the only safeguard left against many possible \ntechnological dystopias.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n1.
